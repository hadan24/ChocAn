Group project for CS 314 at Portland State University

The healthcare services management software developed for chocolate addicts is a powerful tool that helps healthcare providers to record their services to ChocAn members in a simple, user-friendly way. With a well-designed interface, providers can easily manage their clients' health records and ensure that they receive the appropriate services.

The application was built using C++, utilizing object-oriented programming principles to ensure scalability and ease of maintenance. With a single hierarchy, the code is well-structured and modular, allowing for easy customization and expansion in the future.

To ensure the quality and functionality of the application, unit testing was conducted to validate all functions and eliminate potential bugs or errors. This testing process helped to improve the overall performance and reliability of the software, ensuring that it meets the high standards required in the healthcare industry.

Overall, the healthcare services management software is a valuable tool for healthcare providers and ChocAn members alike, providing an intuitive and reliable system for managing health records and delivering essential services to those who need them.
